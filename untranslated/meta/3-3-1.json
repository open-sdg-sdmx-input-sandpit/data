Due to the relatively low incidence of HIV in the UK, a rate per 100,000 population is used rather than the UN specified rate per 1,000 population. Since the duration between HIV infection and diagnosis is often unknown, new diagnoses cannot be used as a direct measure of HIV incidence.","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-06: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/open-sdg-sdmx-input-sandpit/data/commit/2925376d0964815161ffb52b71850c00e4a1c74f","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Rate per 100,000 population","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["Sex","Age","Key populations"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections per 100,000 population","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.3-3-1-title","indicator_number":"3.3.1","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"3.3.1"}
