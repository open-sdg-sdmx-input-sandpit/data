  The data source for this indicator; the Prindex survey, used a sample size of
  1,000 in the United Kingdom. This small sample size limits the reliability of
  the data and restricts our ability to produce detailed further breakdowns of
  the data. We are exploring how to further develop our reporting of this
  indicator with stakeholders from the Department for International Development
  and the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government.
