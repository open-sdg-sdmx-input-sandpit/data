  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) presents
  modelled data for the UK relating to this indicator, and states the prevalance
  of undernourishment in the UK as <2.5% between 2000 and 2016. 


  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and
  has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to
  identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
