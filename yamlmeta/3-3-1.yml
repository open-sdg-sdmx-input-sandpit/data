  These data present information on the rate (per 100,000 population) of people
  newly diagnosed with HIV in the UK by year of diagnosis, country of residence
  and demographic characteristics. Due to the relatively low incidence of HIV in
  the UK, a rate per 100,000 population is used rather than the UN specified
  rate per 1,000 population. Since the duration between HIV infection and
  diagnosis is often unknown, new diagnoses cannot be used as a direct measure
  of HIV incidence.
