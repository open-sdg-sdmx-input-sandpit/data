  Maternal mortality in the UK is measured as a rate per 100,000 maternities
  (defined as women who give birth to a live infant or a stillborn infant at 24
  weeks or greater gestation), and *not* a ratio per 100,000 live births, in
  order to provide a closer approximation of the risk associated with
  pregnancy. 


  Maternal deaths are identified through a variety of sources by the MBRRACE-UK
  collaboration at the NPEU, University of Oxford. Further details of
  ascertainment methods, additional disaggregations, details of causes of death
  and recommendations for improving care can be found in the [MBRRACE-UK Saving
  Lives, Improving Mothers’ Care
  reports](https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports).


  The maternal mortality ratio for the UK, following the UN specification, can
  also be found in the MBRRACE-UK reports using the link above.
