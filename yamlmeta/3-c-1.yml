  The period April to June is being used to report annual data. Note that some
  of the totals will not sum to 100% due to incomplete source data. Where the
  sample size was too small to make a reliable estimate, figures have been
  removed. Please note, the aggregate value for 'Occupation Category - Health
  Professionals' also includes veterinarians, although these have not been
  included as a subcategory.
