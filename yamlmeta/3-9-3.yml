data_footnote: >-
  Rates calculated when there were fewer than 3 death registrations in a cell
  have been surpressed. Rates that are based on between 3 and 19 deaths are
  potentially unreliable, as the measure may be affected by the small number of
  events. These can be seen in the original source data.
