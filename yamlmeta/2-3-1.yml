  Partial productivity shows the impact key inputs have on productivity. It
  measures total outputs against a part of the inputs. The chart below clearly
  shows that labour has to date been the key input in driving productivity
  gains. Productivity by labour shows a steady increase over the whole period.
  Labour volumes are now approximately half of what they were in 1973. However
  over the last few years growth in labour productivity is due to increased
  output rather than a reduction in labour volume.
